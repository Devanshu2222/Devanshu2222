/*
vectors are dynamic  in nature we can resize them where as arrays cannot be resized
to add a element in a vector we use vector.push_back(element)
to remove a element from a vector we use vector.pop_back(element)
to insert a element between a vector we use vector.insert(poistion,element)
to erase a element between a vector we use vector.erase(poision)
to  clear all the elements from the vector we use vector.clear()
